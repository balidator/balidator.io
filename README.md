# balidator.io
Blockchain address validator for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero and more...

# What is balidator.io?
It is possible that your wallet has not been created correctly. Some browsers such as' Safari' generate an incorrect, invalid wallet address if you have used an online wallet generator. With the 'Blockchain address validator' ( https://balidator.io ) you can check your wallet address for correctness. We currently support the validation for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Monero. More are coming soon. If you are a developer, i would be grateful if you contribute and make this project become better.

# Is there an API out there?
Yes, it is, you can find it here: https://balidator.io/api/documentation. Right now it is pretty simple. But more functions are coming soon, hopefully ;)

# When should i verify my blockchain address?
You should check if your generated blockchain address, for example your bitcoin address, is valid before you load or receive coins to it. This makes sure that your coins dont get lost.

# Can i contribute to the project?
